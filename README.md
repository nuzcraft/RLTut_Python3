# RLTut_Python3

following the roguelike tutorial at http://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/v2/

Developing w/ Python 3.9.2 64-bit

I want to use this as an opportunity to:

1. relearn some python
2. relearn some tcod
3. implement unit tests
4. make a roguelike
5. practice with git

## Part 1 Dev Notes

### Drawing the '@' symbol and moving it around

http://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/v2/part-1/

It has been a long time since I did anything significant with python or tcod, so this should be a lot of fun.

Welp, after finishing part one, there is a lot of syntax in here that I'm not very familiar with. I think I understand the gist of what's happening, but it will take some work before I'm fully comfortable with it. Regardless, I'm really enjoying how this is going!

I got movin' and groovin' on unit testing and after some finagling I got a suite of unit tests running on the overwritten ev_quit and ev_keydown functions. I found this to be an educational experience, and look forward to setting up more unit tests as the codebase grows.

## Part 2 Dev Notes

### The generic Entity, the render functions, and the map

http://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/v2/part-2/

I had a good time setting up unit tests and such in part one, and I think part 2 is going to be a challenge. At this exact time, I'm looking at setting up unit tests for the engine scripts, am seeing functions that will be difficult to test, and am looking forward to the puzzle solving.

After quite a bit of futzing, I'm feeling really good about the development process here. Create script, write tests, implement code, see results. I think it will be really interesting to update/fix unit tests as the codebase changes. Part 2 is complete! Looking forward to part 3!

## Part 3 Dev Notes

### Generating a Dungeon

I'm really looking forward to dungeon generation. The procedural nature is probably my favorite part of roguelike development/working through these tutorials. 

This is a test change.
