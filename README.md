# Roguelike Tutorial with Unit Tests

## Python 3 and tcod

Followed the roguelike tutorial at http://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/v2/

Developed w/ Python 3.9.2 64-bit

I used this as an opportunity to:

1. relearn some python
2. relearn some tcod
3. implement unit tests
4. make a roguelike
5. practice with git

I was successful!

Version 1.0 is a complete version of the final game from the tutorial. I've made some minor adjustments here and there, but most of the code matches the tutorial.

In addition to the existing codebase, this project has **329** unit tests that cover _most_ of the major functions. This _should_ make developing additional features easier to do with fewer bugs, though updating existing unit tests can take a bit of time. Note that I am not an expert or experienced tester so there is still much to optimize in my testing.

For anyone that stumples on this repo, I hope you find it useful! I had a lot of fun putting this together.
