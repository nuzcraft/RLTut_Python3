2. relearn some tcod
3. implement unit tests
4. make a roguelike
5. practice with git

It has been a long time since I did anything significant with python or tcod, so this should be a lot of fun.

Welp, after finishing part one, there is a lot of syntax in here that I'm not very familiar with. I think I understand the gist of what's happening, but it will take some work before I'm fully comfortable with it. Regardless, I'm really enjoying how this is going!
